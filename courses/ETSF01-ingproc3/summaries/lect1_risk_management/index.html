<blockquote>
  <p>A risk is a potential problem; a problem is a risk that has materialized</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Fairley 1994]</p>

<h2 id="what-can-go-wrong">What can go wrong?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Staff turn-around: quit, moved to other project, illness</li>
  <li>Tools do not work as anticipated</li>
  <li>Requirements change more than expected</li>
  <li>Effort estimates were wrong</li>
  <li>Expected input/deliveries are delayed</li>
  <li>Quality is not good enough in the end of the project</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-risk">What is risk?</h2>
<p>"An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objective"
 It consists of both a <strong>cause</strong> and an <strong>effect</strong>
 For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use of new compiler (<strong>cause</strong>)</li>
  <li>
    <p>Integration problem &amp;&amp; delayed training phase (<strong>effect</strong>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Low top management priority in Project A (<strong>cause</strong>)</li>
  <li>Resources (staff) moved from project A to another project (<strong>effect</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="risky-commitments---overscoping">Risky commitments - Overscoping</h3>
<p>The main risk of overscoping is that the project target (scope)
will not be met in <em>time</em> and on budget (<em>cost/effort</em>).</p>

<ul>
  <li>The traditional dev model (waterfall) - sequential &amp; doc-driven</li>
  <li>
    <p>"<em>overpromise</em> software capabilities in cortractually binding requirements
specification before they <em>understand</em> their risk implications."</p>
  </li>
  <li>Agile dev model (XP/Scrum) - iterative &amp; code driven</li>
  <li>"… neat ideas… I'll code 'em up, and if they <em>don't fit</em> other 
peoples ideas, we'll just evolve things until they work."</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="risk-management-1">Risk Management</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Risk Assessment
    <ul>
      <li>Identification (What might go wrong?)</li>
      <li>Analysis &amp; prioritization (What are the most serious risks?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Control of risk
    <ul>

<h4 id="approaches-to-risk-identification">Approaches to risk identification:</h4>
<p>Includes but isn't limited to:
 * Use of checklists, check which risks may come up based on previous experience.
 * Brainstorming - getting knowledgeable stakeholders together to pool concerns.
 * Casual mapping - Identifying possible chains of cause and effect using a map.</p>

<h5 id="method-decision-tree">METHOD: Decision Tree</h5>

<p>In this scenario we ponder on wether or not to extend or replace a system.
The outcome of this depends on if the market expands or not.
If we extend the system and the market expands we lose -100.000$, if it doesn't expand
we will gain 75.000$.
If we replace the system and the market expands we gain 250.000$, if it doesn't
expand we lose 50.000$

<h5 id="risk-reduction-leverage-is-a-method-of-comparing-different-options-by-comparing-risk-exposures">Risk reduction leverage is a method of comparing different options by comparing risk exposures.</h5>

<p>RRL = (RE_before - RE_after)/(cost of risk reduction)</p>

<p>RE_before is risk expose before risk reduction, e.g. 1% chance of
a fire causing $200k dmg.</p>

<p>RE_after is risk exposure after risk reduction, e.g. $500 alarm
which reduced probability of fire dmg by 0.5%</p>

<p>RRL = (1% of $200k - 0.5% of $200k)/$500 = 2
RRL &gt; 1.00 <em>therefore worth doing</em></p>

you want to review them.</p>

<h5 id="assessing-the-likelihood-of-meeting-a-target">Assessing the likelihood of meeting a target</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Imagine now that the target for completing A+B+C was 52 days.</li>
  <li>Calculate the Z-value as (T - t_e)/s = (52 - 48.65) / 3.32 = 1.01</li>
  <li>Match the Z-value with a probability by using a pre-existing table.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which results in a 15% chance of <strong>NOT</strong> meeting the target 52 days.
And that's PERT for you, kids!</p>

<h4 id="problems-with-estimates-of-task-duration">Problems with estimates of task duration</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Estimators usually add a safety zone to cover difficulties</li>
  <li>Developers work to the estimate, meaning the time is lost</li>
  <li>No advantage is taken of opportunities where tasks can finish early - and
provide a buffer for later activities</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parkinson's law:</p>

  <p>Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion</p>

  <p>=&gt; All buffers are usually consumed by end of the project.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="basic-ideas-of-critical-chain">Basic Ideas of Critical Chain</h4>
<p>To reduce time wasted, a critical chain is constructed as such:</p>

<p><code>
 _____ __
|_____'__| ____ __
          |____'__| ___ __
                   |___'__|
</code></p>

<p>Move all buffers to the end and halve them.</p>

<p><code>
 _____
|_____| ____ 
       |____| ___ ___
             |___'___|
</code></p>

<p>Thus, the buffers have been reduced in half so that people don't waste time!!!</p>

<h4 id="critical-chain-approach">Critical Chain Approach</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Ask the estimators for two estimates
    <ul>
      <li>Most likely duration: 50% chance of meeting this</li>
      <li>Comfort zone: additional time needed to have 95% chance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Schedule all activities using most likely values and
starting all activities on latest start date</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>“Critical chain” the same as “critical path” but resources
also considered</li>
  <li>Put a project buffer at the end of the critical chain with
duration 50% of sum of comfort zones of the activities
on the critical chain</li>
  <li>During project execution monitor how much of the
buffer that has been used</li>
  <li>Supported in tools, e.g. through add-on to MS Project</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="executing--and-monitoring-critical-chain-plans">Executing  and monitoring Critical Chain plans</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Principle: focus your efforts - ”multitasking is evil”
    <ul>
      <li>No chain of tasks is started earlier than
scheduled, but once it has started is finished as
soon as possible</li>
      <li>This means the activity following the current one
starts as soon as the current one is completed,
even if this is early – the relay race principle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fever charts are used to monitor progress and catch tasks at risk</li>
