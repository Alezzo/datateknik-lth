<h2 id="projects-projects">Projects, PROJECTS?!</h2>
<p>Unlike jobs, which is a repetition of well-defined and well understood tasks,
a project is more explorative and is temporary (meaning it has an end).</p>

<h3 id="what-is-project-management">What is project Management?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Planning - deciding what is to be done</li>
  <li>Organizing – making arrangements</li>
  <li>Staffing – selecting the right people for the job</li>
  <li>Directing – giving instructions</li>
  <li>Monitoring – checking on progress</li>
  <li>Controlling – taking action to remedy hold-ups</li>
  <li>Innovating – coming up w solutions for problems</li>
  <li>Representing – liaising with clients, users, developers
and other stakeholders</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="software-projects-vs-other-engineering-project">Software Projects vs Other Engineering Project</h3>
<p>No difference except for:
 * Invisibility
 * Complexity
 * Conformity to "laws of the nature"
 * Flexibility</p>

<h3 id="projects---general">Projects - General</h3>
<p>The measurement of a projects success or failure is the degree to which objectives are met.</p>

<p>An example would be a project running out of time, which could be recovered by:</p>

<p>A. Reducing the scope of the project. which would in turn reduce the lead time (total time for the project from start to finish)</p>

<p>B. Increasing the costs/spent effort by adding more resources to the resource pool</p>

<p>On average, a software project costs 30% more than planned.
1/6 of IT projects are 'black swans' meaning it costs 200% more than planned and takes 70% more time than planned.</p>

<h3 id="software-project-management---main-areas">Software Project Management - Main Areas</h3>

  <li>Effort estimation</li>
  <li>Risk management</li>
