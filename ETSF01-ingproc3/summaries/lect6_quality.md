## Practical
* Quality plan
* Define criteria for activities & include inspections
* When are we done?
  * Monitoring quality levels
  * Release decision based on quality measurements

## Quality Plan
A quality plan can be seen as a checklit that all quality
issues have been dealt with by the planning process.

* scope of plan & references to other documents
* quality management, incl organization, tasks, and responsibilities
* documentation to be produced
* standards, practices and conventions, reviews and audits
* testing strategy and plan
* problem reporting and corrective action
* tools, techniques, and methodologies
* code, media and supplier control
* records collection, maintenance and retention
* training
* risk management - methods of risk management that are to be used

## Clear criterias for activities/inspections
* Entry requirements - test data and expected results prepared
* Implementation requirements - "when error is found, do this and that"
* Exit requirements - done when all tests ok

## When are we done?
It is not possible to **know** when there are no more errors, this
has to be estimated. Using testing techniques or expert opinion.

### Result

* Successful?
  * Delivered on time
  * Delivered within budget
* Gains
  * Quality product that meets customer need
  * New lessons learnt (experience, process improvements)

## Summary
* Quality is a vague concept, things have to be carefully defined
* Most qualities that are apparent to users can only be tested with the complete product
* Need ways of testing during development to see how the final product will behave
* Some techniques concentrate on testing the product of the development process, while others test the
process itself.
