## Organizational structures
An organizational structure is needed to form and manage 
groups in large projects. 

### Formal versus informal
The *formal* structure focuses on *authority*, about who has which
boss. This is usually the base of the organization's structure.
When the "unexpected happens" the *informal* structure takes over,
this structure consists of spontaneous contact and communication
between the members of the staff while working.
The informal organization gets built up and unofficial ways are
found around the obstacles imposed by the formal structure.

### Hierarchical approach
Each member of the staff only has one manager, and the manager 
has responsibility for several staff members. Authority flows
top down. A concern with this approach is *span of control* - 
the number of people that a manager control.

### Staff versus line
*Line* workers produce the end product, support *staff* carry out
supporting roles (think IT-department).

## Reporting
### Formal
#### Regular
* **Oral** Progress meetings
* **Written** Job sheets

#### Ad Hoc
* **Oral** Review meetings
* **Written** Issues reports

### Informal
#### Regular
* **Oral** Around the coffee machine
* **Written** Emails to collegues

#### Ad Hoc
* **Oral** Ad hoc meetings
* **Written** Emails for issues investigation

## Leadership
Leadership is the ability to influence other and achieve a common goal.
Management includes leadership, as well as organising, planning and controlling.
Both exercise power but in different ways, position power (formal authority; rewards,
punishment)
or personal power (individual qualities; an expert, access to information).
