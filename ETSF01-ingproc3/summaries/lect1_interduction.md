#L1: Introduction & Risk Management

##Projects, PROJECTS?!
Unlike jobs, which is a repetition of well-defined and well understood tasks,
a project is more explorative and is temporary (meaning it has an end).

###What is project Management?
 * Planning - deciding what is to be done
 * Organizing – making arrangements
 * Staffing – selecting the right people for the job
 * Directing – giving instructions
 * Monitoring – checking on progress
 * Controlling – taking action to remedy hold-ups
 * Innovating – coming up w solutions for problems
 * Representing – liaising with clients, users, developers
and other stakeholders

###Software Projects vs Other Engineering Project
No difference except for:
 * Invisibility
 * Complexity
 * Conformity to "laws of the nature"
 * Flexibility

###Projects - General
The measurement of a projects success or failure is the degree to which objectives are met.

An example would be a project running out of time, which could be recovered by:

 A. Reducing the scope of the project. which would in turn reduce the lead time (total time for the project from start to finish)
 
 B. Increasing the costs/spent effort by adding more resources to the resource pool

On average, a software project costs 30% more than planned.
1/6 of IT projects are 'black swans' meaning it costs 200% more than planned and takes 70% more time than planned.

###Software Project Management - Main Areas
 * Activity planning
 * Effort estimation
 * Risk management
 * Resource allocation
 * Monitor & control execution
